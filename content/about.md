Well, let's see I'm Kaustubh a Computer Science undergrad. Total Cyber Security nerd. I tend to write code, use it and then delete it thinking I'll never really need it again.

I solve CTFs and watch Mr. Robot and try to implement those tactics is IRL to get that unparalleled technical accuracy, or atleast try to.

Hope you gain some insight from my perspective of things.
