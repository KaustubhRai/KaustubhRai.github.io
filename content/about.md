Hey there! I’m Kaustubh. I'm a Computer Science undergrad. and a total Cyber Security nerd. I tend to write code, use it and then delete it thinking I’ll never really need it again.

I am a comic aficionado, a couch potato. If I am not busy with my studies, I solve CTFs and in my spare time watch Mr. Robot and try to implement those tactics IRL to get that unparalleled technical accuracy, or at least try to.

Hope you find something you like on my blog!
