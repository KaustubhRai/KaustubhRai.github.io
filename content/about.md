Well, let's see I'm Kaustubh a Computer Science undergrad. Total Cyber Security nerd. I tend to write code, use it and then delete it thinking I'll never really need it again.

I am a comic aficionado, a couch potato. If I am not busy trying to pass my engineering exams I solve CTFs and in my spare time watch Mr. Robot and try to implement those tactics is IRL to get that unparalleled technical accuracy, or at least try to.

Hope you gain some insight from my perspective of things.
