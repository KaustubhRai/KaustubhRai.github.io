 Everyone has heard about hackathons, this is especially true for a university full of engineering students. However, not many of us have actually experienced one before. I had never participated in one until just recently. Before this, I had the common misconception that a hackathon (hack+marathon) only involves coding for an entire day, which is why I never participated (because I am terrible when it comes to coding). In actual fact, not all hackathons are about coding, as the main aim of the event is problem-solving. A prime example of such a hackathon is the **Cypher Hack** a national-level cybersecurity hackathon conducted by Computer Society of India at 'Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology', unlike other hackathons this was a security hackathon where we had to create stuff that would be needed in the world of cybersecurity.

 My first time even attending a hackathon and that too a security hackathon the pressure, anxiety, nervousness, the excitement was REAL. My team comprised of 3 other members, 2 of which I had never met, we met at the venue and talked about how we would tackle the problem statement.
 There were topics given by the people who were organizing this event. We choose our own, our problem statement was **Automated Vulnerability Assessment Using a Falcon Pi Device Remotely**. That is a big word for a project in itself, let me explain it to you word by word.
 #### What is Vulnerability Assessment

 Every organization is a target for hackers. The best thing a company can do is conduct an audit[^1]. Audits are a way to detect security vulnerabilities in the system or the network of the organization with various techniques, the same techniques as that of a real-life black hat hacker aka ***bad guys*** . It focuses on identifying vulnerabilities[^2] in the network, server, and system infrastructure.

 Adding *Automated* in front of it now means we are just doing it automatically by the push of a button or here in this case by the help of *Pi* device, Pi is just a dumbed-down version of a computer with Linux as it's OS in it and it's the size of a credit card, you plug it in devices and it works. All of this means that we were making something that was going to help companies do the security *stuff* faster and it's cheap and the size of a credit card. **FANTASTIC!** right? 

 #### Presentation 
 We had to present it now in front of the judges as what we were building, 3 hours had been already up. One of the judges in that panel was Venkata Satish, who has been awarded CISO[^3] of the year in India, so in my mind, I had to present it right as my first impression.
 
 #### Break
 After 5 hours or so, we had a break from our work station and in that time period, I got to interact with the remaining teams in the hackathon (I mean, you are basically stuck with everyone in the same area for the entirety of the event) there were 15 teams or so, and all of their projects were really innovative and it was inspiring as to see how they were tackling their problem statements effectively. Even though everyone was busy perfecting their prototype and bringing their ideas to life throughout the event, we still managed to mingle around and meet new friends along the way. 
 
 Here's a glimpse of what problems were given to us:

 People making projects on Blockchain and OSINT were the most eye-catchy ones as not a lot of people use these technologies or get their hands *dirty* as for most of them it looks overkill.

 After the break time, couple hours passed our project's hardware side had been finished, and we were working on the front end side to make it more User Friendly for people to use and understand. Before the final round advisors came, and they were inspecting our work and asking us questions related to our project, these people were professionals who are experts in the field related to hackathons and cybersecurity. Each of them then started asking us questions, different questions on how it would help different scales of companies, on how a person not having a computer background can operate these devices, etc. They explained to us and cleared some of our doubts on how companies think and why they would need our product and how we need to sell it to a company and which type of companies mostly. It was a really informative session with all of them. Not only they were able to see gaps within our idea, but they were also able to add on to what we already have.
 
 ### Finals

 Around working for 12 hours on this project we needed to show it to the judges, whether complete or not, we still had kinks we needed to sort in our project, it still wasn't entire * User-Friendly*. But we showed the judges on what we have been working on, we explained it to them, all of it on how you can start the Pi device remotely and conduct the VAPT audit.

 After a while, all the teams were then called for the announcement of which teams had won, they gave us insight on how a team needs to perform in a hackathon such as this, what preparations had to be made before and how we needed to manage and gauge our time properly, how we need to present it more professionally in front of the panelists, what we will do with our made product in the future and how we will work on it to make it more efficient. After this they called out names of the team to present them with what they have won, our team name was also called. We had secured 1st place in the hackathon, 2 of my team members were offered Internships on the spot, and then we got a cash prize of 15K. We all agreed that the real prize was the pride and happiness we got out of winning the competition and defeating other teams.

 P.S -

 If you are interested and want to see the rest of the project my teammate has written a perfect blog explaining how you can program this type of product yourself, here's the link [EXPLANATION](https://haxbabatech.blogspot.com/2020/04/build-your-own-red-team-dropbox-for_9.html) check it out. I did not explain any programming stuff here anyways that we did in the project, this was just my experience, visit it for more coding stuff, it's REALLY good.
