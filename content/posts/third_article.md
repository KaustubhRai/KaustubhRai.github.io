Every cyber-security enthusiast has once come upon these terms **OWASP Top 10**. 

The ```Top 10``` here means Top 10 Vulnerablities, the greatest software risks for any Web Application. OWASP is just an online community/non profit foundation that helps to improve the security of software for free.

To combat said vulnerablities and protect your website, [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) provides a room to pratice these vulnerabilities and teach you about each vulnerability. How it occurs and how to exploit it. 
Link for the room - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop10)

I practiced this room a while back and wrote posts on Linkedin on how to solve each challenge. This is a culmination for all those posts in one place. This is a mind map for all the things that are taught in that room
